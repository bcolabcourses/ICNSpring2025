# Project

Congratulations! You've made it to the end. Check out the project description:

[here](https://bcolabcourses.github.io/ISIfall2024/static_files/assignments/ISI2024FinalProject.pdf).  

Remember you can only use four grace days for your proposal submissions, and for the final submission, no grace days will be given as we'll try to give you the latest submission deadline possible.
