## Report Templates

We provide two report templates (not mandatory, but **strongly suggested**) for submitting your assignments:

- [**Word Template**](https://bcolabcourses.github.io/ICNSpring2025/static_files/REPORT_TEMPLATE_change_this_name_to_HW#_Lastname_StudentNumber.docx)  

- [**LaTeX Template**](https://bcolabcourses.github.io/ICNSpring2025/static_files/REPORT_TEMPLATE_change_this_name_to_HW#_Lastname_StudentNumber.zip)

These templates help maintain a consistent format for all submissions. Simply **rename** the file to match your homework number, last name, and student ID, then either fill out the DOCX or compile the LaTeX version. If you already have your own preferred report style, you may continue using it after asking permission from the homework team, but we recommend using this simple template for clarity and uniformity.

## **Structured Learning Path for Statistical Foundations**

### **1. Understanding Data Distribution and Normality**
- **[Standard Deviation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esskJJF8pCc)**  
  *Explains standard deviation, a key measure of data dispersion in statistics.*

- **[Boxplot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INSIyaZUXIY&t=253s)**  
  *Explains how boxplots work and how they visually represent data distribution.*

- **[Normality Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVketBmpUTE)**  
  *Describes how to test if a dataset follows a normal distribution, a crucial step in many statistical tests.*

---

### **2. Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing**
- **[Confidence Interval â€“ Simply Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENnlSlvQHO0)**  
  *An easy-to-understand explanation of confidence intervals and their significance in statistical analysis.*

- **[T-Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VekJxtk4BYM)**  
  *A detailed introduction to the t-test, used for comparing means in hypothesis testing.*

- **[Paired T-Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7IW2PUqe64)**  
  *Explains the paired t-test, used for comparing two related samples or measurements.*

- **[Wilcoxon Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZsL2eDQiDQ)**  
  *Introduces the Wilcoxon test, a non-parametric alternative to the t-test for paired data.*

- **[Mann-Whitney Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twk6lBhBl88)**  
  *Explains the Mann-Whitney U test, a non-parametric method for comparing two independent groups.*

---

### **3. Comparing Groups and Relationships Between Variables**
- **[Chi-Square Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpKzq64GA9Y)**
